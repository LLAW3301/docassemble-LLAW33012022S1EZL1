## About

This web application streamlines the initial intake process for the legal firm Ezra Legal and their clients. Ezra is able to obtain vital preliminary information and documents prior to the initial face-to-face meeting, and their clients have access to a modern, highly accessible web app that intelligently guides them through questions (in plain and familiar language) to provide information required for identifying the legal issue and providing effective services.
